                        and Increase ROI</h2>
                    <p class="para-space">Website traffic and Return on Investment(ROI) are generally intertwined.
                        Higher the traffic, chances of
                        increased ROI are also higher(though not always true). Increasing the inbound traffic to your
                        digital
                        space can be achieved through various routes. But the relevant type of traffic is attained when
                        it is
                        from your targeted audience.</p>

                    <p class="para-space">A majority of the website visitors reach the site through organic search or
                        via a link. Talking about the
                        popular search engine, Google, it shows 10 results per page. More often than not, people search
                        for a
                        particular keyword when looking for making a purchase or trying to find relevant information.
                        Almost 70%
                        of the traffic is restricted to the first 5 organic results and more than 90% of the entire
                        traffic is
                        restricted to the first page of a search result. So you can say goodbye to any chance of
                        increasing
                        inbound traffic if your site shows up on the 8th or 10th page.</p>

                        immediate future but can lead to your site getting penalized in the long run, which can even
